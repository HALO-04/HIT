<h1>Question</h1>
<p>The fastfood chain McBurger owns several restaurants along a highway. Recently, they have decided to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurant and supplying several of the restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots.
To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification: You will be given the positions of n restaurants along the highway as n integers d1 &lt; d2 &lt; ... &lt; dn (these are the distances measured from the company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore, a number k (k &lt;= n) will be given, the number of depots to be built.
The k depots will be built at the locations of k different restaurants. Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the total distance sum, defined as

</p>
<p>must be as small as possible.
Write a program that computes the positions of the k depots, such that the total distance sum is minimized.

</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line containing the two integers n and k. n and k will satisfy 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 200, 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 30, k &lt;= n. Following this will n lines containing one integer each, giving the positions di of the restaurants, ordered increasingly.
The input file will end with a case starting with n = k = 0. This case should not be processed.

</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each chain, first output the number of the chain. Then output a line containing the total distance sum.
Output a blank line after each test case.

</p>
<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre><code>6 3
5
6
12
19
20
27</code></pre>
<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre><code>Chain 1
Total distance sum = 8</code></pre>
